/* The following set.*Bitfield and get.*Bitfield functions implement setting
 * and getting arbitrary size (up to 64 bits) signed and unsigned integers
 * at arbitrary positions into a bitmap.
 *
 * The representation considers the bitmap as having the bit number 0 to be
 * the most significant bit of the first byte, and so forth, so for example
 * setting a 5 bits unsigned integer to value 23 at offset 7 into a bitmap
 * previously set to all zeroes, will produce the following representation:
 *
 * +--------+--------+
 * |00000001|01110000|
 * +--------+--------+
 *
 * When offsets and integer sizes are aligned to bytes boundaries, this is the
 * same as big endian, however when such alignment does not exist, its important
 * to also understand how the bits inside a byte are ordered.
 *
 * Note that this format follows the same convention as SETBIT and related
 * commands.
